0,"The U.S. government cannot issue any drilling permits that authorize the use of hydraulic fracturing and acidization off the coast of California until it issues a full Environmental Impact Statement, a federal appeals court held Friday."
1,"The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said the Obama administration violated the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) in May 2016, when it found that no EIS was necessary because fracking, acidization and other advanced “well stimulation techniques” would have no significant impact on the environment."
2,"Rather than take the “hard look” required by NEPA, two agencies of the U.S. Interior Department relied on “flawed assumptions,” brushed aside gaps in their knowledge as well as known risks in an apparent attempt to justify their earlier practice of allowing offshore fracking and acidization without any environmental review, Circuit Judge Ronald Gould wrote for the panel."
3,"“NEPA review cannot be used as a subterfuge designed to rationalize a decision already made … But that appears to be what happened here,” Gould wrote, joined by Circuit Judges J. Clifford Wallace and Carlos Bea."
4,"The decision affirms and expands a December 2018 ruling by a federal judge in Los Angeles in consolidated cases brought by the Environmental Defense Center, the Center for Biological Diversity, other environmental groups, the state of California, and the California Coastal Commission."
5,"The judge found the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management and the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement had violated the Endangered Species Act and another environmental law, but not NEPA."
6,"He ordered the agencies to stop issuing permits until they consulted with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Coastal Commission – which they are still doing, the 9th Circuit said."
7,The agencies’ lawyer did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Friday.
8,"The decision is also a loss for Exxon Mobil, drilling services firm DCOR, and the American Petroleum Institute, which intervened as parties in support of the agencies, and had no immediate comment."
9,Attorneys for the challengers hailed multiple aspects of the decision.
10,"California Attorney General Rob Bonta emphasized the dangers of offshore drilling generally, and called the agencies’ finding of no significant impact “fundamentally untrue”."
11,Kristin Monsell of the Center for Biological Diversity added that requiring the Interior Department to prepare an EIS – generally a multi-year process – means the public will have an opportunity to comment “and otherwise be involved in the agency’s decisionmaking process”.
12,"In addition, the decision is important because the court rejected the government’s argument that its findings were “insulated from judicial review” — until a new permit is issued, EDC Senior Attorney Maggie Hall said."

53,Massachusetts' high court on Tuesday unanimously rejected Exxon Mobil Corp's (XOM.
54,N) bid to dismiss a lawsuit by the state's attorney general accusing the oil company of misleading consumers and investors about climate change and the dangers of using fossil fuels.
55,The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court said Attorney General Maura Healey could pursue what Exxon called a politically-motivated case that it claimed violated a state law protecting defendants from lawsuits designed to silence them.
56,"Justice Scott Kafker, writing for the 7-0 court, said the statute protecting against strategic lawsuits against public participation only applied to private lawsuits, not government enforcement actions."
57,"Applying the so-called anti-SLAPP law to such cases would create ""significant roadblocks"" for the attorney general as the statute requires lawsuits to be largely put on hold until a court decides whether to dismiss them, Kafker said."
58,"Healey, a Democrat running for governor, called the decision ""a resounding victory in our work to stop Exxon from lying to investors and consumers in our state""."
59,"Irving, Texas-based Exxon said it was evaluating its next steps."

61,Her lawsuit has progressed further than other pending cases by state and local governments seeking to hold energy companies responsible for climate change.
62,Exxon in 2019 following a trial defeated a case by New York alleging it defrauded investors.
63,Exxon denies wrongdoing and argues Healey brought the case to punish it for its political stances on climate change.
64,The ruling marked the second time Healey and Exxon had gone before the state's top court.

66,Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.
67,"N) shareholders on Wednesday backed the energy company's board and its energy transition strategy, voting against most proposals to accelerate cuts of carbon emission."
68,Major oil producers this year flipped the script and won over investors to their climate-change strategies as worries over energy security and fuel prices overshadowed environmental resolutions.
69,"At Exxon, results marked a major shift from a year-ago when activist investors secured three seats on its board."
70,"Shareholders voted down a resolution from Dutch activist group Follow This that sought to set targets for reducing its customers' emissions from burning its fuels, called scope 3."
71,Only 28% of votes that were cast backed the proposal.
72,"If approved, it would have reduced sales of fossil fuels, and made the company set and publish medium- and long-term targets for cutting overall greenhouse gas emissions."
73,Chief Executive Darren Woods said the company is expanding investments in fossil fuel production to minimize a global energy shortage and the rising prices for consumers.
74,"""We don't believe scope 3 targets are an effective way to manage total society emissions,"" Woods said."

82,"Exxon shareholders also rejected calls to replace directors by re-elected its board, and supported the company’s executive compensation program."
83,News that Exxon Mobil will spend $3bn in the next five years on a new low-carbon business unit came after a flurry of announcements signalling that America’s biggest fossil fuel producer has finally accepted that it may need to change course in the face of climate change.
84,"It remains to be seen whether it will be enough to silence Exxon’s legion of critics, including the Attorney General of Connecticut, who in September filed the latest of a wave of lawsuits from US states and cities accusing Exxon Mobil of “an ongoing, systematic campaign of lies and deception” to discredit the scientific consensus about human-induced climate change, despite knowing since the 1970s that fossil fuel production caused global warming."
85,"As late as October, Exxon Mobil’s CEO Darren Woods dismissed the suggestion that climate change concerns posed long-term risk to his industry, reassuring staff that there would be “an ongoing need for the products we produced”."
86,"On the face of it heightened investor pressure from activist investor Engine No 1, backed by heavyweight institutions like the Church Commissioners for England and US hedge fund DE Shaw, have forced Exxon to move into line with US number 2 producer Chevron, with which it is rumoured to be in merger talks."
87,"Before Christmas the Irving, Texas oil major announced a five year programme committing to cut the intensity of CO2 emissions from its upstream production by 15-20% by 2025, and decrease the intensity of methane, a far more potent greenhouse gas, by 40-50% – though this is far lower than the 65% cut in methane emissions by 2025 being proposed by the Clean Air Task Force and under consideration by the Biden administration."
88,"Like Chevron, Exxon’s new targets apply only to Exxon’s scope 1 and 2 emissions, from its own operations, as set out in the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard."
89,"But given that its products fuel the world economy, scopes 1 and 2 account for less than 20% of an oil company’s total emissions."
90,"Scope 3, or the impact of its products in use, accounts for the rest."
91,"While Exxon recently announced it would begin reporting on its Scope 3 emissions this year, US producers lag far behind European energy majors Royal Dutch Shell, BP, and Total, which last year signed up to in committing to net-zero emissions by 2050 across all three scopes."
92,"Royal Dutch Shell coloured in its net-zero plans for investors in February, announcing that it was cutting back oil production by 1-2% a year and speeding up its timeline to reduce the net carbon intensity of each unit of energy it produces."
93,"By 2035 this will be 45% less than 2016, compared to 30% previously, and 100% by mid-century, from 65%."
94,"The oil major will increase investment in renewables, including biofuels and hydrogen, build out its EV charging services network, and boost carbon capture and storage to store an additional 25m tonnes a year by 2035."
95,"More controversially, it is also planning a major investment in offsetting, with a target to offset 120m tonnes of its customers emissions by 2030."
96,"Shell’s green energy renewable energy targets aren’t as ambitious as those of BP and Total, which earlier in February announced plans to rebrand itself as TotalEnergies as it transforms into a broad energy company over the next decade."
97,"BP, meanwhile, plans to grow its renewable output 20-fold, while slashing oil output by 40% by 2030, a far more decisive shift than Shell’s 1-2% per year."
98,"Still, in an industry first, shareholders will have an advisory vote on Shell’s transition plan at this year’s general meeting, while the pay of more than 16,500 staff, not just top executives, will be linked to targets to reduce the carbon intensity of its energy products."
99,It is not just the European energy majors that are far ahead.
100,"The Science-based Targets initiative, a partnership between CDP, the United Nations Global Compact, World Resources Institute, and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), reported in January that 34% of all European companies with the greatest climate impact have committed to, or set, targets in line with science to cut CO2 emissions, in contrast to just 16% in North America and 12% in Asia."
101,But are even European companies doing enough to bend the curve on dangerous climate change?
102,"As we reported in the December issue of The Ethical Corporation, until later this year, when the SBTi will publish a new global standard, there has been no standardised mechanism for third-party monitoring and verification, or for companies to report transparently on how they are actually performing against their targets."
103,And even the SBTi does not yet provide rules on reducing scope 3 emissions.
104,"Meanwhile, there has been a proliferation of many more companies setting net-zero targets with no grounding in science, with a major chasm opening between net-zero ambition and concrete action."
105,"According to research by Signal Climate Analytics, about one-third of human-caused greenhouse gas emissions can be tied to the direct and indirect business activities of just 250 companies, which include the world’s biggest oil and gas companies, along with companies in the energy-intensive transport, mining, metals, and manufacturing and consumer goods sectors."
106,"That number excludes privately held and state-owned companies, for which it is much more difficult to obtain high quality, verifiable data."
107,"But the direct and indirect emissions of the G250 and their value chains are huge, and they wield enormous power over sector peers, regulatory frameworks and even consumer attitudes about climate change."
108,"In short, where these businesses are going with their treatment of our planet, we are all going."
109,Over the course of 2021 Reuters and Signal will be delving into the extent to which those 250 companies are taking action to bring their operations in line with 1.
110,"5C pathway, focusing on 25 companies per month."
111,"Given the incompleteness of the data, we will list them in their sectors alphabetically, making it easier to draw comparisons between companies within sectors on their climate risk performance, and to answer two key questions: how transparent are they about their total GHG emissions and related environmental impacts, and are they decarbonising fast enough to avoid the worst consequences of an over-heated planet?"
112,"The story told by the related chart, looking at the first 25 companies, is not encouraging, given that they alone account for approximately 10% of annual human-caused emissions."
113,"The energy sector dominates, accounting for 17 of the 25, but only three, Royal Dutch Shell, BP and Total, having set a Science Based Target to reduce their emissions."
114,"Another nine are doing the bare minimum by admitting that climate change is an important risk, or by disclosing only emission from their own operations."
115,"In other sectors, Thyssenkrupp, Vale, and VW are disclosing plans, although not always including all scopes, to adopt 1."
116,"5C aligned science-based targets, showing they are on a path to systematically transform their core products, processes ‒ and in some cases business models ‒ with solutions that reduce or eliminate harmful environmental or climate change impacts."
117,"Among them is U.S.-based diesel-engine manufacturer Cummins, a signatory to the SBTi’s Business Ambition for 1."
118,"5C coalition, which has investing meaningfully in a new power segment, combining the company’s electrified powertrains, fuel cells and hydrogen production technology."
119,"Over the last three reporting years, GHG emissions across all scopes fell 7% while revenue increased, decoupled from emissions, by 15%."
120,The company also reported record profitability in 2019.
121,"This will be a pivotal year on the climate scene, as big carbon is pushed harder than ever to become better for our global economy and planet."
122,"The new Biden administration will bring the United States back to the regulatory discussion, and market signals are likely to continue to increase both the transition opportunity for innovators, and the risk for laggards."
123,"Given this push, many expect the gulf between European companies and in the US on climate risk to narrow, with many more Americans firms among those setting zero-carbon targets in the run-up to the critical COP26 climate conference in Glasgow in November."
124,"As the year progresses, Reuters and Signal Climate Analytics will be updating both the transparency and performance data on our G250 list."
125,"Given the urgency of action between now and 2030, we hope to help make a meaningful contribution to revealing where firms are actually turning over a new green leaf, and how the underlying business of carbon intensive industry is transforming”."
126,UBS Asset Management has excluded Exxon Mobil (XOM.
127,"N) and four other ""unresponsive"" energy companies from its climate aware range of funds, including one managed for UK pension scheme NEST, the firms said on Monday."
128,"The asset management arm of UBS also divested from Imperial Oil, Kepco, Marathon Oil and Power Assets following a three-year engagement programme with 49 oil and gas companies identified as lagging on climate change performance, the firms said in a statement."
129,The exclusions also apply to UBS' actively-managed equity and fixed income sustainability funds.
130,"Oil major Exxon Mobil Corp, under increasing pressure from investors and climate change campaigners, said on Monday it planned to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions over the next five years."
131,"Last Thursday, the Church Commissioners for England joined growing investor campaigns to demand changes at Exxon and backed calls for a board refresh and development of a strategy for the largest U.S. oil company’s transition to cleaner fuels."
132,"Several of Exxon’s rivals this year have set longer-term climate ambitions, including Royal Dutch Shell and BP Plc, which aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050."
133,"Exxon said it would start reporting so-called Scope 3 emissions in 2021, a large category of greenhouse gases emitted from fuels and products it sells to customers, such as jet fuel and gasoline."
134,"By 2025, Exxon would reduce the intensity of its oilfield greenhouse gas emissions by 15% to 20% from 2016 levels."
135,"It did not set an overall emissions target, however, and reducing intensity means that emissions still could rise if oil and gas output grows."
136,"The reduction would be supported by a 40%-50% decrease in methane intensity and a 35%-45% decrease in flaring intensity across Exxon’s global operations, with routine natural gas flaring eliminated within a decade, the company said."
137,Since the 2015 Paris climate accord set a goal of keeping global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius (3.
138,"6 F), pressure from investors has increased and some of Exxon’s peers have agreed on more ambitious targets."
139,"Exxon said its goals were in line with the Paris accord, which the United States exited under President Donald Trump but that President-elect Joe Biden has pledged to rejoin."
140,"“We certainly recognize the direction of travel that Paris sets out and the ambitions for society to get to net zero as early as possible before the end of the century,” Peter Trelenberg, ExxonMobil director of greenhouse gas and climate change, told a news conference on Monday."
141,“What we have tried to do is to develop specific actionable plans that we can hold our organization accountable to drive continuous improvement in emissions”.
142,"Further goals would be set as the 2025 targets are met, Trelenberg said."
143,"‘NOTABLE TURN’  The targets are “encouraging news and doubtless a response in part to expanding shareholder pressure,” said Timothy Smith, director of ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) shareowner engagement at Boston Trust Walden Co, which has backed several shareholder proposals seeking improved disclosure at Exxon and other companies."
144,"“They had long opposed detailing Scope 3 emissions, so this is a notable turn for them."
145,And Exxon is known for its strength in managing policy pledges it makes”.
146,"The new targets do not address product emissions, a “main source of risk,” said Andrew Logan, senior director of oil and gas at sustainability nonprofit Ceres."
147,"“At a time when even U.S. peers like Occidental and ConocoPhillips have set net-zero targets for their operational emissions and committed to addressing their product emissions, this effort from Exxon falls short”."
148,Exxon said it would meet goals it set in 2018 by the end of this year to cut methane emissions by 15% and flaring by 25% compared with 2016 levels.
149,"Last week, Engine No."
150,"1, a $250 million California-based firm, called for expanded spending and pay cuts at Exxon, a board shake-up and a shift to cleaner fuels."
151,"Its views were supported at least in part by the California State Teachers’ Retirement System (CalSTRS) and hedge fund D.E. Shaw, which has $50 billion under management."
152,"In May, Exxon’s second-largest shareholder, BlackRock Inc, voted in favor of an independent chairman and against the re-election of two directors over Exxon’s approach to climate risks."
153,Exxon Mobil Corp on Wednesday said for the first time in a securities filing that some of its oil and gas properties may face impairment due to climate change.
154,The largest U.S. oil company’s board will test assets for climate impairments “in the context of overall enterprise risk” during the annual asset review by its board of directors.
155,"“Certain assets could be at risk for impairment,” it said."
156,Exxon’s 12-member board was overhauled in May with three new directors in a proxy battle that weighed heavily on the company’s past failure to address climate change.
157,Hedge fund Engine No.
158,1 was successful in convincing enough shareholders a new board could improve performance and rethink the energy transition strategy.
159,"The company for years has acknowledged risks to investment returns, demand and costs associated with climate change, and won a 2019 court fight against New York state’s Attorney General who alleged Exxon’s assessments failed to consider potential impairments for climate-related risks, a spokesperson said."
160,"Directors will analyze factors including future energy supply, regulation, government policies and greenhouse gas restrictions, the company said in the regulatory filing."
161,"Until asset recoverability assessments “are complete, it is not practicable to reasonably estimate the existence or range of potential future impairments,” Exxon said."
162,"The company “views climate change risks as a global issue that requires collaboration among governments, private companies, consumers and other stakeholders to create meaningful solutions,” the filing said."
163,"“It’s a welcome shift that ExxonMobil’s new board is forcing the company to face the reality that the climate crisis it helped cause and the transition to a clean energy economy will have major financial impacts on its assets and bottom line,” Ben Cushing, Campaign Manager for the environmental organization Sierra Club’s Fossil-Free Finance campaign said."
164,"Exxon on Friday promised to increase spending to $15 billion between 2022 and 2027 on measures to cut its carbon emissions, the largest budget among U.S. majors, in what was seen as a first climate strategy change under the new board."
165,"Exxon and other U.S. oil majors’ climate strategy relies developing from scratch new decarbonization technologies that are currently years away from becoming commercial, like carbon capture and hydrogen."
166,Top executives of the U.S. producers were grilled before Congress last month here for their communication strategy on global warming.
167,"They were also questioned for focusing their business on oil and gas production, while European producers have started to shift away from fossil fuels towards renewable sources of energy like solar and wind power."
168,"The top U.S. producers here have decided against investments in solar and wind power projects, with investors onboard."
169,(Reporting by Sabrina Valle Editing by Marguerita Choy)Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.
170,"N) was suspended from advocacy group Climate Leadership Council (CLC) that looks to make policies to address climate change, the CLC said on Friday."
171,The move comes a little over a month after an Exxon lobbyist said the company supports a carbon tax publicly because the plan to curb climate change would never gain enough political support to be adopted.
172,"Exxon Chief Executive Officer Darren Woods had condemned the comments""."
173,"After careful consideration, we have decided to suspend ExxonMobil's membership in both the Council and Americans for Carbon Dividends, our advocacy arm,"" CLC CEO Greg Bertelsen said in a statement."

178,PA).
179,The CLC's decision marks a u-turn after it supported the oil major in June after the lobbyist's comments.
180,"Exxon said in a statement the CLC's decision was ""disappointing and counterproductive""."
181,"""It's more important than ever for organizations to work together to advance meaningful policy solutions to address shared challenges and society's net-zero ambitions,"" it said."
182,"The company said it would continue to be a part of the Alliance for Market Solutions, an organization that also works to try and reduce carbon pollution."
183,"The non-profit organization World Resources Institute (WRI), a CLC member, said Exxon was not aligned with the council's push to put a price on carbon as a key response to the climate crisis."
184,"""We welcome CLC's separation from Exxon,"" the institute's CEO, Ani Dasgupta, said in a note, while calling on companies to support a price on carbon in any future legislation that advances in Congress."
